    <h1>CallMeNot Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 7, 2026</p>

    <p>AppsStudio HQ ("we", "our", or "us") operates the CallMeNot mobile application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>CallMeNot requires certain permissions to function as a call screening app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phone Number (for authentication):</strong> We use Firebase Phone Authentication to verify your identity. Your phone number is stored securely by Firebase and used only for account verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> We access your contacts locally on your device to help you build your whitelist. Contact data is stored only on your device unless you enable cloud sync.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Log:</strong> We read your call log to display call history and identify recent callers. This data remains on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Call Screening:</strong> We use the CallScreeningService API to intercept and filter incoming calls based on your whitelist settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To authenticate your account via phone number verification</li>
        <li>To screen incoming calls based on your whitelist preferences</li>
        <li>To display call history within the app</li>
        <li>To sync your whitelist across devices (only if you enable cloud sync)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your whitelist, call log, and settings are stored locally on your device using encrypted storage.</p>
    <p><strong>Cloud Sync (Optional):</strong> If you choose to enable cloud sync, your whitelist is securely stored in Google Firebase Firestore, associated with your authenticated account. You can delete this data at any time from within the app.</p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information with third parties, except:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For authentication and optional cloud sync services (operated by Google)</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> For subscription management and billing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including encryption for stored data and secure transmission protocols.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data within the app</li>
        <li>Delete your account and all associated data</li>
        <li>Export your whitelist</li>
        <li>Opt out of cloud sync at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>CallMeNot is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the app and updating the "Last Updated" date.</p>
